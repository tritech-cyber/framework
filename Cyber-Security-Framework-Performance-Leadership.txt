********************************************************************************
C1: 	Safety
Performance Assessments: 
YEAR 1
- Students will complete the safety course and assessment with a focus on eye safety, electricity safety, hand tool safety and general lifting safety.
- Teacher lecture
- Teacher demonstration
- Read Text/Manual
- Student guided practice lifting

Safety Rules Activity A
Safety Activity 1
Safety Activity 2
Students are assessed with a rubric and online test
YEAR 2
Students demonstate use of hand tools for use with RJ45 and 568B punch down.
Students present safety guidelines to year 1 students.
********************************************************************************
C2: 	Career planning (Tri-Tech Portfolio)
Performance Assesments:
YEAR 1
Employability:  All students are assessed on an employability rubric consisting of:  
Positive Attitude and Teamwork:  
Works effectively with others and contributes productively as a member of the team; 
Professional Etiquette: 
Understands and uses professional behavior and language; Appearance and Hygiene: Exhibits appropriate professional appearance and hygiene; Attendance and Punctuality: Contributes to the learning environment by consistent attendance; Self and Resource Management: Appropriate use of materials, resources and time; Equipment Safety and Maintenance: Utilizes equipment efficiently and safely.  The Employability Rubric is integrated into all standards. The students are assessed on the employability rubric each week by the instructor.

Academic Portfolio: All students are required to complete an academic portfolio, which includes a resume, application, application letter, mission statement, employability skills rubric, program competency checklist (grades, progress report, transcripts, industry certifications, leadership, final project including a presentation and reflection paper, best works, high school & beyond plan, and log of outside hours (30 hours minimum including community service).

The studentâ€™s culminating (final project) is a presentation of their final reflection paper and academic portfolio.  The project is assessed by the teacher, students, and guests using rubrics. 

Students are required to complete a cost projection for educational training and design a spreadsheet for long term amortization of loan payment in order to estimate the cost of paying of student education loans.

YEAR 2
Students refine and add to their current portfolio.
Students use their portfolio as an example to first year students.
Students have an opportunity to job shadow.

********************************************************************************
C3: 	Security ethics, security levels, security threats and defensive security. 
Performance Assessments: 
YEAR 1
- Research long term cost analysis of security deployment in industry.  Cost comparison for virus protection and cost to consumer.
- Research cost analysis to repair malware and viruses.  Is it cheaper to re-install or repair? (OWT.COM in Kennewick charges $60 to $70 per hour.)
- Linux Permissions based on value. Decimal to binary.
- Students do hands on activities (configure security level on a client work station and server; cyber security threats to computers and networking hardware; defensive security strategies and manage cloud storage ethically)
- Students monitor Google Suite for Education (G Suite for Education )
- Students will manage a personal Github.com account with an email not associated with thier home school.
- 
- All assessments and activities will be assessed by the instructor with rubrics.

YEAR 2
- Students will teach year 1 students in use of G Suite for Education .
- Students will model use of github with year 1 students.
- Students will manage a remote Linux and Windows server and deploy security measures.
